# comp-chem-visualizations

Computational/physical chemistry visualizations/demos. Primarily based on assignments completed for various chemistry courses at Cornell University.

Currently a work in progress, as I break down four years worth of project and problem set submissions into bite-size pieces that I hope will be instructive for others. The long-term goal is to provide live web demos for all of these, but for now you should be able to run them all yourself, either directly using Jupyter or using Voilà (see below).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter
- Voilà

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Notebooks with Voila
```bash
voila <notebook-name.ipynb>
```
Access the application at http://localhost:8866.
